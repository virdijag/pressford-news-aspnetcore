# Pressford News Assessment

Using .NET Core

## The business problem
W. Pressford is a partner at Pressford Consulting. One of the business problems Mr. Pressford has is delivering the latest news to the business, as the company has many employees. Instead of sending an email to the entire business, he would like to create a system to which he can publish the latest news for all the employees to view. In addition, he would also like to be able to gauge interest in each article.

## Requirement
Develop a website suitable for a pitch or very limited MVP. You need to please both Mr. Pressford and the other developers in the group who might need to take on the project and complete it without you.

The system should do the following:

[] There should be a simple menu bar which allows you to navigate across the site, along with some dummy pages with placeholder text.
[] A publisher should be able to publish news articles. The article should have a title, body, publish date, and any other fields you think wouldbe valid e.g. author.
- A publisher should have the ability to edit and remove an article.
- An employee should be able to see a list of news articles, and read each article.
- Employees should have the ability to “like” an article. Ideally each user has a limited amount of “likes” they can provide.
- It should be possible to identify which article has the most likes.
- A user can log on and identify themselves, as an employee or publisher. (You do not have to implement password storage as this is just a demonstration to the client).

[] Ideally he would be able to see some type of graphic. E.g. the number of likes plotted against each article on a chart.
[] If time allows, Mr. Pressford would really like employees to have the ability to comment on each article.
